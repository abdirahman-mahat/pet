    <p>Toss the food around the room.Continue increasing the distance by tossing it further. You will be able to feed your dog entirely by just playing this game.</p>

    <p>Place the three cups upside down on the floor, take the ball, show your pet, hide it under one cup.</p>
    <p>Using your hands, pass the cups around in order to mix the arrangement.</p>
      Once you are sure the dog will not find it, you can request the pet to point the cup where the ball is. If they point correctly, you give them a treat.
